    "# Predictive IT Infrastructure Management: CPU Usage Forecasting\n",

    "**Copyright (c) 2026 Shrikara Kaudambady**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a machine learning approach for a critical IT infrastructure management task: **resource forecasting**. Specifically, we will predict future server CPU utilization based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Without accurate forecasting, IT teams either over-provision resources (wasting money) or under-provision them (risking performance degradation and outages). \n",
    "**Solution:** We will use `Prophet`, a powerful time-series forecasting library developed by Facebook, to build a model that learns trends and seasonal patterns from past CPU usage to predict future demand."

    "We have successfully built a forecasting model that can predict future CPU demand with reasonable accuracy. The component plots clearly show that the model has learned the underlying patterns in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How an IT Manager would use this:**\n",
    "1.  **Capacity Planning:** By looking at the upward trend in the forecast, a manager can see that CPU usage is projected to increase. The upper bound of the forecast (`yhat_upper`) can be used as a threshold to decide when to provision new hardware or allocate more virtual resources.\n",
    "2.  **Anomaly Detection:** If the *actual* CPU usage significantly exceeds the forecasted `yhat_upper`, it could trigger an alert, indicating an unexpected problem that requires investigation.\n",
    "3.  **Maintenance Planning:** The seasonality plots show that usage is lowest overnight and on weekends. This information can be used to schedule maintenance and updates during periods of low impact."
